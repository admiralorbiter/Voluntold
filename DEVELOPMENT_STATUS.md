# Development Status & Progress Tracker

## üéØ Current Sprint: Archive System & District Linking

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

#### Archive System Implementation
- [x] **Database Schema**: Added `status` field to `UpcomingEvent` model
- [x] **Sync Logic**: Modified to archive full events instead of deleting them
- [x] **Auto-Reactivation**: Events become active again when slots become available
- [x] **Dashboard Views**: Added toggle between active and archived events
- [x] **Visual Indicators**: Status badges and styling for archived events
- [x] **API Endpoints**: `/api/events/archive` for archived events data
- [x] **Testing Tools**: `create_test_data.py` and `test_archive_functionality.py`

#### Code Quality Improvements
- [x] **JavaScript Refactoring**: Fixed scope issues with view toggle functionality
- [x] **Error Handling**: Better error messages and user feedback
- [x] **Status Messages**: Loading and success indicators for all operations
- [x] **Console Logging**: Debug information for troubleshooting

### üîÑ NEXT PRIORITY: Automatic District Linking

#### Problem Statement
Currently, staff must manually link each event to districts. This is time-consuming and error-prone.

#### Goals
1. **Automatically detect** which district an event belongs to based on event data
2. **Reduce manual work** for staff
3. **Improve accuracy** of district assignments
4. **Maintain manual override** capability for edge cases

#### Technical Approach
1. **Pattern Matching**: Analyze event names for school/district keywords
2. **Location Data**: Use any available location information from Salesforce
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle variations in naming conventions
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Show confidence level for automatic assignments
5. **Manual Review**: Flag low-confidence matches for staff review

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Study existing event names and district patterns
   - Identify common naming conventions
   - Map school names to districts from `school-mappings.csv`

2. **Algorithm Development**
   - Create district matching logic
   - Implement confidence scoring
   - Add fuzzy string matching

3. **Integration**
   - Add to sync process
   - Update dashboard to show automatic assignments
   - Allow manual overrides

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test with real event data
   - Validate accuracy
   - Gather staff feedback

### üìã BACKLOG ITEMS

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Enhanced Event Filtering**: Search, date range, type filtering
- [ ] **Virtual Event Support**: Handle online/virtual events
- [ ] **Event Display Order**: Allow staff to control event ordering

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple events for batch actions
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: CSV/Excel export of event data
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Track changes to events and settings

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Event performance metrics
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Improve mobile dashboard experience

### üß™ TESTING STATUS

#### Archive System
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Basic functionality verified
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Dashboard toggle working
- [x] **Manual Testing**: Archive view functional
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Need to test with real Salesforce data

#### District Linking
- [ ] **Pattern Analysis**: Need to analyze existing event names
- [ ] **Algorithm Testing**: Match accuracy validation
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Sync process impact

### üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READINESS

#### Archive System
- **Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR PRODUCTION
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Rollback Plan**: Can disable archive logic if issues arise

#### District Linking (Future)
- **Status**: üîÑ IN PLANNING
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (affects core functionality)
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep manual linking as fallback

### üìä METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA

#### Archive System Success
- [x] No more lost event configurations when events fill up
- [x] Staff can view archived events easily
- [x] Events automatically reactivate when slots become available
- [x] Dashboard performance maintained

#### District Linking Success (Targets)
- [ ] **Accuracy**: 90%+ automatic matches correct
- [ ] **Efficiency**: Reduce manual linking by 80%
- [ ] **User Experience**: Staff can easily review and override automatic assignments
- [ ] **Performance**: Sync process remains under 30 seconds

### üîç TECHNICAL DEBT

#### Immediate
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for archive functionality
- [ ] Implement proper logging for sync operations
- [ ] Add input validation for district linking

#### Short Term
- [ ] Refactor JavaScript for better maintainability
- [ ] Add error boundaries and graceful degradation
- [ ] Implement proper loading states

#### Long Term
- [ ] Database optimization and indexing
- [ ] API rate limiting and security
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
